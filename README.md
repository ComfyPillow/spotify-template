# spotify-template
This template is an optional starting point for a challenge for the following [course](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/) at the University of Washington.  The instructions are described [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/spotify).


1. What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
The purpose of this app is to be able to sample music or lookup artists and find related artists who may have similar music. It also provides popularity rankings of the music in regards to the spotify population as a whole. 

2. What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
http://students.washington.edu/gngcp/info343/spotify-template/

3. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Yes, Jack Whitesell from Lecture A helped me with explaining how to properly interpret the API data as well as advice for other random bugs. He also helped me review a bit of the material from the lectures as I had been sick and absent for over a week. 

4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
16 hours
4~6 was spent learning and understanding the lecture material that I missed
approximately 3 was spent coming up and testing ideas (couldn't get echonest to work)
the rest went to working and debugging

5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
